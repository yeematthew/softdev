    <h2>Splash</h2>
    <h3>Bio</h3>

        <h4>Origins:</h4>
        <p>
          Hailing from the Atlantic Ocean, Splash is a blue whale who has made her way onto land through a special flesh-to-yarn conversion procedure. She fled from the ocean due to the worsening water pollution and declining fish populations all around the globe, but still considers it her true home. She is a worldly whale, having traveled four of the five oceans and all seven seas. As such, she is always eager to travel and experience other cultures.

        <h4>Current Standing:</h4>
        <p>
          A friend from a volunteer program at the New York Aquarium offered Splash as a parting gift on our last day on the job. Needless to say, I happily accepted, and Splash has resided in my room, and occasionally on my balcony, every since.

    <h2>Parky</h2>
    <div class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
      <div class="cell small-6">
        <h4>Origins:</h4>
        <p>
          Parky was a gift from a close friend of mine. When I first met him, I was thinking that he would be "just another stuffed animal sitting at home." Just kidding. Parky is actually a disciple of Po, the fluffy panda. Although Parky is not as fluffy, he harbors a creative attitude, trying to understand new things through touching them. Parky's father is Gitae Park (who's known for more shadiness than greatness), and his mother is unknown.

      <div class="cell small-6">
        <h4>Latest Appearance:</h4>
        <p>
          Parky has currently taken a temporary leave in order to train for greatness. He's been waddling across the world on his 1 inch legs, testing new techniques and trying new food. You might be able to find him out in the wild if you look hard enough, or you might be mistaking a black and white splotch of paint for the great Parky. If you stick around his dad, I guess you might see him too (I forgot to mention that he's on a side mission to find his dad, who left to get milk but never came back.)
