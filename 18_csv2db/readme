Notes:
- Declaring a column as an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY datatype makes it such that each value is unique, but also affects
the order of the rows in the table.
  - Lower integers are placed higher on the list, higher values placed at the bottom.
  - This still works if said integer is inserted into the table as a string.
- Cursor is an object that allows you to interact with the database through terminal commands in the form of strings.
