Prediction: If app.py is ran, it will open a browser page that will have "fooooo" rendered on it, and every item in coll on a new line for each.
Results: Opened a browser page title "fooooo" and rendered every item in coll on a new line.

Q0:
Prediction: The browser page would produce an error.
Results: Same as prediction.

Q1:
Prediction: The URL would be at http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template.
Results: Same as prediction.

Q2:
