    Flying Karate Masters: Matthew Yee, Kevin Li, Joseph Wu
    <h1>
        Hello fellow flying karate master
    </h1>
        Your username is {{username}} 
        <br>
        Request method is {{method}}
        <br>
        <br>
        The only differences we know of are that GET requests send information to request.args and display the information inputted in the URL, 
        while POST requests send information to request.form and do not display inputted information in the URL. They seem functionally the same otherwise.
