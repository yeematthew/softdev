DISCO:
- Grids make placing content side by side much easier than just using CSS would make it.
  - Content within each column will always be center-aligned, but there is likely a way to change that.
- Bootstrap has a lot of very specific classes, which can affect both the size and color of certain elements.
- Many of the features that can be implemented anywhere else on the page (ie: buttons, disabled links, dropdowns, search bars) can also be implemented into the navbar.
